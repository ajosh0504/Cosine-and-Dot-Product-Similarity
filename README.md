# Cosine-and-Dot-Product-Similarity
 Compare the retrieval performance of two different similarity measures, i.e., dot product and cosine similarity.
# Pre-processing the input files:
The inputs should be such that a folder called 'docs' contains all documents, with one file for each document and a folder called 'queries' with a file for each query.
The folders 'docs' and 'queries' contain examples of how the inputs should look. Ofcourse, in order to actually appreciate the effectiveness of these similarity measures, we would need a large number of docs and queries.
